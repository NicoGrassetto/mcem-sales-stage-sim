# Microsoft Customer Engagement Methodology (MCEM)

## What is MCEM?

**MCEM** stands for **Microsoft Customer Engagement Methodology**.

It is Microsoft's unified framework for engaging customers across the entire lifecycle, designed to connect all customer-facing roles (sales, customer success, industry solutions, and partners) into one team. The goal is to deliver consistent, customer-centric engagements that drive business outcomes.

MCEM is central to **MCAPS (Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions)** motions and is supported by detailed playbooks, orchestration guides, and role accountabilities.
